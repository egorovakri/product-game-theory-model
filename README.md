🧠 Game Theory for Product Managers

By Kristina Egorova

What if your product team wasn’t just executing — but playing a game of incomplete information?
These models use game theory to help product managers navigate trust, signaling, and coalitions when leading without formal authority.

📘 Part I – Signals, Escalations, and Trust

Core idea:
Every choice you make — especially escalation — signals your "type" to the team.

Key elements:

Players: PO, QA, Dev, and Manager
Each has a hidden type: Compliant or Stubborn
Strategies: Negotiate vs Escalate, Quality-first vs Time-bound, Sprint Goals vs Tech-first
Payoff matrices show how combinations affect delivery outcomes and trust
Escalation may get things done short-term — but it erodes trust long-term
🧩 This is a Bayesian game. Types are hidden. Beliefs evolve through observation.

📗 Part II – Coalitions, Incidents, and Debt

Core idea:
Players don’t act in isolation — they form quiet coalitions that shape delivery outcomes.

What’s new:

Teams form alliances like PO+QA or QA+Dev — often without explicit alignment
Ignoring QA increases incident risk and scrutiny
Ignoring Dev leads to technical debt and slower future velocity
The PO’s real leverage lies not in escalation, but in proactively forming strategic coalitions
📊 Decision trees and new payoff matrices show how delivery, risk, and trust evolve across sprints.

🔮 Part III – Coming Soon: Incentives, Politics, and Shadow Players

In development:
Model 3 will explore how external pressures, incentive misalignment, and “invisible” players (e.g. senior stakeholders, other POs, adjacent teams) influence the game. We'll look at:

Stakeholder power maps
Conflicting success metrics
Long-term vs short-term optimization
How “shadow games” affect trust, team strategy, and product success
